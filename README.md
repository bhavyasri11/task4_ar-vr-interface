**DISCRIPTION OF THE TASK WHAT I HAVE DONE**:

This project is a conceptual AR/VR interface design for an NFT platform called Collector. It features an immersive landing screen where users can discover, buy, and sell exclusive digital assets in a visually 

engaging environment. The interface is designed with a transparent layout to blend naturally into an AR/VR setting, enhancing user experience. Key elements include a featured NFT display, intuitive navigation for

exploring the marketplace, collections, and shop, as well as clear call-to-action buttons. The design was created using Figma and follows AR/VR interaction principles to simulate a futuristic digital collectibles 

experience.
